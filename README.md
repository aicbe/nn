The video explains
* What is Machine Learning? Humans learn from past experiences, computers learn from previous data.
* Linear Regression: Finding the line that works best between a given set of points.
* Gradient Descent : Square of error minimization to get best line fit
* Detecting Spam e-mails with Naive Bayes Algorithm
* Decision Tree
* Logistic Regression
* Neural network as a logistic regression set intersection
* Support Vector Machine with linear optimization
* Kernel trick: planes for curves and vice-versa
* K-Means clustering
* Hierarchical Clustering
* Summary
